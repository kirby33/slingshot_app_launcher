SlingShot App Launcher

This is an extension for Gnome Shell that adds a new application launcher,
modelled after SlingShot, the application launcher from Elementary OS
(http://www.elementaryos.org).

History of versions:

    1: First public version
    2: Highlights the icons when the mouse cursor files over them
    3: Code much more compliant with Gnome Shell style
    4: Fixed three forgotten "this."
    5: Allows to move the Activities button inside the menu and
       disable the hotspot
    6: Packed the schemas (forgotten in version 5)
    7: Better use of standard CSS
       Tries to keep the size of the meny as steady as possible, by
       tracking the maximum size used
    8: Reduces the icon matrix when the screen is small (based on code
       from kirby33)
       Now doesn't show empty pages
       Allows to customize the style of the main button (with/out icon
       or text)
    9: Allows to choose between categories mode or pure icon mode
       Now highlights all the possible buttons
